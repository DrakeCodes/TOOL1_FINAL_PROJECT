# TOOL1_FINAL_PROJECT
Data analysis project assessing air quality in London, UK. 

This dataset has been collected from the London Air Quality Network, an environmental research group apart of King's College London. In a modern attempt to more acaurtately assess and predict local air quality hazards, this team has been implemented to improve air pollution monitoring. 
This study specifically is aimed at looking at the time sentivty/ seasonality of two common pollutants, nitric oxide (NO) and particulant matter (PM10). I've taken the hourly averages of each polltunat over a years span to determine, which months presents as the minimum and maximum outputs for each pollutant and the time of day, (day or night) where the output of each respective pollutant is most potent.
